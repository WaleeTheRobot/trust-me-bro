## Nerd Stuff

- Line based on Kalman Filter, which dynamically updates its estimates based on the autocorrelation previous values with volatility consideration.
  -- Slightly increase Q if you think the line is not responding quick enough to changes.
  -- Slightly increase R if you think the line is reacting too much to changes.
